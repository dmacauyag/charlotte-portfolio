                I have always been passionate about drawing; however, it was my love for children that lead me to teach art to k-6th grade students. I noticed that once I sparked their curiosity and creativity, students hit the ground running with all their effort and passion, and the outcome was evident in their art. It was this experience that motivated me to intern in an elementary school classroom. Upon stepping into the classroom on my first day and seeing the teacher’s interactions with the kids, I knew that teaching was for me. I noticed how the teacher spoke with students professionally and this gave students autonomy for their work. At the same time, the teacher set a positive atmosphere that made students feel safe and loved. Today I carry these same values, and I always remember that students will learn naturally when their interest and creativity is sparked, and when they are given the love and support needed to succeed.

                My vision for teaching and learning aligns with educational philosopher, John Dewey’s belief in student-centered learning, paired with the theory of social emotional learning. Dewey challenged traditional education by stating that students must actively engage in learning through the use of hands on activities rather than being passive members who are expected to absorb information bestowed onto them. Such hands on learning allows students develop their own understanding of material as each individual will make their own personal gains independent of others.  Dewey believes a teacher’s role is that of a coach; teachers should enforce rules that simulate rules students must adhere to in society, yet allow flexibility in their thinking and learning experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have adopted John Dewey’s constructivist approach to instructional strategies and student learning by guiding student-centered instruction in order to promote an individualized learning experience. For instance, in my second student teaching placement, I facilitated Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) lessons that allowed students to be active participants in their learning rather than passive vessels ready to be filled with knowledge. In these CGI lessons, I gave students a problem on the board with ample time to develop a solution through the use of manipulatives. I then allowed for students to share their methods in mathematical problem solving on the board. Students demonstrated their unique thinking because they were given rules that allowed for flexibility, yet were not restrained to a specific procedure, thus creating their own individual learning experience. The active role of teaching and learning that I facilitate aligns with Dewey’s philosophy.

                Social emotional learning (SEL) is the process of learning social and emotional skills; such skills include the ability to managing emotion and behaviors, have empathy, solve problems, make responsible decisions and maintain healthy relationships with others. Social emotional skills are essential for success in school, work and life as it allows students to do better academically and have improved attitudes and behaviors as a result of increased self advocacy and autonomy. There are many contributing factors that affect students social and emotional development both inside and outside of school; therefore, it is the responsibility of educators to make sure students are making a conscious and active effort to support each student in developing social emotional skills that will help them successfully navigate their everyday realities. Social Emotional Learning is essential to every classroom and is something I prioritize as an educator. To develop an SEL classroom, I set clear expectations for my students, maintain a positive tone, and model SEL practices in the classroom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through my masters course, I found that the research behind SEL as a pedagogy has reaffirmed the practices that I have already put in place based on my own values and intuitions for the social and emotional wellness of my students. In my classroom, I set the tone for the year by getting to know my students and sharing about myself with my students. Building report with students is the key to building trust in the classroom. I build social emotional learning into the curriculum. One example of this is quick writes about a characters actions in a book (example question: “Do you agree with Buck’s actions? How might you have reacted differently if you were in Buck’s situation?” I also actively practice SEL conflict resolution strategies, such as an SEL stepping mat, when working with students one on one to resolve arguments. My passion for teaching stems from my strong belief that students should learn to become autonomous beings with who can manage their emotions and behaviors, have empathy for others, problem solve, and maintain healthy relationships.

          <h3>Respect</h3>
          <p>
            All people need and deserve respect; when mutual respect exists, trust happens and a healthy community follows. I know students learn best when they feel heard, challenged, valued and loved., It is my passion as an educator to build rapport and strong relationships not only with each student, but also their families. I reach out and involve my students families as much as possible by sending weekly newsletters, inviting parents to help out in the classroom, and making myself available to meet in person. In doing so, I aim to gain trust that I have my students best interests in mind. Building a trusting community is essential in order to establish a safe environment for students to take chances, make mistakes and grow. In establishing a positive environment that fosters growth mindset, I help to optimize student learning opportunities and set students up for success for a challenging, engaging and rewarding year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyday I model respect in my demeanor and interactions with each of my students. Each morning I greet my students by name with a prefered greeting (hug, handshake, fistbump, etc), and facilitate a morning meeting followed by community circle. I speak professionally with my students in order to foster autonomy and problem solving. I always provide each student with warmth and support to communicate with my students that they are cared for and safe. I believe it is important for students to see themselves in their classroom with their writing on the board and their work on the walls. Community circles are an essential part of the day because it allows students to reflect on how they are feeling and practice active listening and respect for their peers. When students listen actively to each other, the result is apparent in their language and actions during cooperative work. This friendship building routine sets the tone for the day and provides an outlet for students to share their needs. My classroom climate is one where students feel recognized, celebrated, autonomous and can take pride in their own work and their growth.

          <h3>Educate</h3>
          <p>
            I believe students learn best when they are set up for success, have the opportunity to self-assess, and given immediate feedback; for these reasons, frequent informal and formal assessments drive my curriculum. These assessments based on the unit essential question and lesson objective. Providing students with multiple means of expression through the use of open ended assessments increases student interest and confidence, whether it is graded or not. Students are set up for success when they believe they are able to accomplish a challenge. By creating low anxiety around assessments students feel capable of challenging their thinking. I preview the assessment before a lesson so students feel they are held accountable for their learning and gain intrinsic motivation. Incorporation of self assessment is a valuable learning tool because students minds grow when they identify their own mistakes and fix them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Timely feedback is essential because students feel more engaged and capable in their abilities to complete a task. My lessons are planned around timely feedback. For example, when teaching a third grade paragraph writing lesson with the objective to construct a thesis statement for or against a specific cause (chosen by students). My assessment at the end of the lesson was for students to write their objective on a post it note and place it on a poster under the topic of their choice. My class silent read while I called students up one by one who needed coaching on their thesis. In this way, I provide immediate feedback before drawing the lesson to a close, and made sure each student got the one on one attention needed to accomplish the learning goal. I aim to use assessments to promote growth mindset, autonomy, and intrinsic motivation in order to build a community of lifelong learners.
          </p>

          <h3>Advocate</h3>
          <p>
            The word “advocate” is one used often by myself and my students and tied into our literature and curriculum. As a class we learn what the word advocate means, and what it means to advocate for something or someone. I make it clear to my students and my parents that I am an advocate for each of my students learning and growth. In order to advocate for all my students, I make sure I am facilitating learning opportunities that will best help each of my students grow. To accommodate each of my unique learners, I use an Universal Design for Learning approach in my lesson planning. I provide multiple means of representation, expression and action, and engagement. When planning a lesson I visualize each of my learners and make changes that accomodate all of my students, I am then able to differentiate where necessary. I also hold small group meetings each day in order to provide intervention support for my students. As an educator, it is my focus to advocate for my students and provide them with the kind of learning they need to be successful.
